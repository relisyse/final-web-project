          <p class="use-my-custom-font2">Lara started her career by training at Splinters collage of Mayfair and then worked in numerous salons in Surrey becoming a trainer at Regis, training over 50 salons in the Southern region and doing stage work for salon International as part of the Regis artistic team.<br>
            Lara then joined the Headmasters team at Kingston, followed by the Rush salon group in Wimbledon and Fulham achieving a hair industry award.<br>
            In 2010 Lara joined the Stuart Phillips team where she continues being creative on many different projects. This has included working with Stuart on his well known YouTube videos showing the public different colouring skills (as Lara specializes in colour corrections).<br>
            She has also produced two 5 page spreads in the bite magazine showcasing avant-garde hair piece collections, as well as a full page feature including styling a models hair and being interviewed herself in Red magazine in collaboration with L’Oreal Professional.

            Lara’s specialities are colour corrections, so if you have had a colour disaster or just fancy a major change, this is her speciality.<br>

            Lara will also offer you hare care advice for the future to prevent such damage ever occurring again.

            Lara’s clients have now named her the hair doctor.
